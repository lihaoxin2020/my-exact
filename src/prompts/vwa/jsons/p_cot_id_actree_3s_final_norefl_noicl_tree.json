Each bounding box and its respective id shares the same color.\nThe observation, which lists the IDs of all interactable elements on the current web page with their text content if any, in the format [id] [tagType] [text content]. tagType is the type of the element, such as button, link, or textbox. text content is the text content of the element. For example, [1234] [button] ['Add to Cart'] means that there is a button with id 1234 and text content 'Add to Cart' on the current web page. [] [StaticText] [text] means that the element is of some text that is not interactable.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous action: This is the action you just performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n```click [id]```: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n```type [id] [content] [1/0]```: Use this to type the content into the field with id, followed by pressing ``Enter`` to submit the form [1] or no submission [0].\n```hover [id]```: Hover over an element with id.\n```press [key_comb]```:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n```scroll [down]``` or ```scroll [up]```: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n```new_tab```: Open a new, empty browser tab. Note that most tasks can be completed with the tabs we provided.\n```tab_focus [tab_index]```: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab. Note that tab_index starts with ZERO (e.g., ```tab_focus [0]``` switches to the FIRST tab, and ```tab_focus [1]``` switches to the SECOND tab).\n```close_tab```: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n```goto [url]```: Navigate to a specific URL.\n```go_back```: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n```go_forward```: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n```stop [answer/url]```: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer (e.g., price), provide the answer in the bracket. If the objective is to find a link(s) to an item/post(s), provide the exact url(s) in the bracket (for example, stop [http://xxx]).\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com.
